Add a derivatives lint checker:

Check for a Hopmepage

Check for a maintainer

Sanitise all inputs to prevent security issues.

Check for strange headers in Release, Packages, Sources.

Check that each of the headers has a policy conformant value.

Check for Original-Maintainer on derived packages.

Add statistics & graphs:

number of packages (total, modified, copied)
number of headers of each type

Add a layer for merging with external configs, reporting diffs

compare script: rsync down files when unable to connect to postgres
