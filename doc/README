Welcome to the Debian derivatives census scripts!

The scripts can be run manually or via a framework based on make.
If using the make-based framework data from each derivative is
stored in a subdirectory of the var directory. The scripts are
named in self-explanatory ways and take the names of input and
output as command-line arguments.
