Welcome to the Debian derivatives census scripts!

There are currently two approaches used with two sets of scripts.
One of the approaches will be removed if the other is better.

Some files are common to both approaches:

etc/wget.conf: sets some parameters
bin/fakegpgv: a fake gpg verifier to silence apt

The first splits up the actions and performs each action on all derivatives:

The results are grouped into directories based on the data type.

etc/census.conf: directory configuration
bin/setup: setup the directories needed
bin/update-derivatives-list: creates a list of derivatives from the wiki
bin/update-wiki-pages: downloads text versions of all the wiki pages
bin/update-sources-lists: extracts sources.list snippets from all the wiki pages
bin/update-package-info: updates all the package lists from the sources.list snippets
var/wiki/*.txt: the text versions of the wiki pages
var/apt/sources.list.d/*.list: the sources.list snippets
var/apt/lists/: the apt package lists

The second uses make and gives each derivative a subdirectory.

Makefile: the main makefile machinery
Makefile.deriv: used by each derivative directory
bin/get-wiki-html: downloads the HTML version of a wiki page
bin/get-wiki-text: downloads the text version of a wiki page
bin/get-package-lists: downloads the package lists
bin/wiki-html-to-derivatives-list: converts the census wiki page to a list of derivatives
bin/wiki-text-to-sources-list: extracts a sources.list snippet from a wiki page
var/census.html: the HTML version of the census wiki page
var/template.txt: the text version of the census template wiki page
var/derivatives: a list of names of derivative wiki pages
var/*/wiki.txt: the text versions of the derivative wiki pages
var/*/sources.list: the sources.list snippets
var/*/apt/: the apt package lists
