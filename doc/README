| Welcome to the Debian derivatives census scripts!

The Debian derivatives census scripts aim to take information added to the
Debian derivatives census wiki pages and aggregate, expand, check, massage and
transform it in order to integrate information useful to Debian contributors
into the Debian infrastructure. More information about Debian derivatives and
the derivatives census is available on these wiki pages:

https://wiki.debian.org/DerivativesFrontDesk
https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census
https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Integration
https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/CensusQA
https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/CensusFull

The scripts are run via a framework based on make. With the make-based
framework, data from each derivative is stored in a subdirectory of the
var directory. The scripts are named in self-explanatory ways, take the
names of input and output as command-line arguments and contain comments
indicating their purpose and if non-obvious, how they work.

/-------------------------------------------------
| Make machinery

Makefile.{var,deriv} are symlinked from the var/ dir and from each of the
directories for the derivatives. They setup environment variables, declare
files to be generated, their dependencies and how to create them.

Makefile: the main makefile machinery, used to setup var dir
Makefile.var: used to aggregate files and setup derivative dirs
Makefile.deriv: used by each derivative dir to create files

/-------------------------------------------------
| Scripts

All the scripts are stored in the bin/ directory and run by the make-based
framework.

These download information from the Internet:

get-url
get-url-eol-fix
get-blogs-rss
get-distrowatch-stats
get-favicon
get-favicon-img
get-logo-img
get-package-lists
get-wiki-html
get-wiki-text

These extract information from census wiki pages:

wiki-html-to-derivatives-list
wiki-text-to-blogs-list
wiki-text-to-dev-blogs-list
wiki-text-to-distrowatch
wiki-text-to-homepage
wiki-text-to-logo
wiki-text-to-name
wiki-text-to-sources-list

These convert data files to be suitable for Debian infrastructure:

logo-to-planet-head

These create configuration snippets for Debian infrastructure:

derivative-to-planet-config
derivative-to-planet-head
derivative-to-debtags

These aggregate configuration for Debian infrastructure:

aggregate-planet-config
aggregate-planet-heads
aggregate-debtags

These check the derivatives for potential issues:

check-package-list
check-sources-list

These compare the derivatives with Debian:

compare-planet-config
compare-planet-heads
compare-source-package-list

These are hacks to deal with the apt OpenPGP key stuff:

fakegpgv
gpgv

/-------------------------------------------------
| Configuration files

These are stored in the etc/ directory.

curl.conf: sets some parameters for curl
htaccess.*: sets some parameters for Apache
architectures: list of Debian related architectures

You can update the list of architectures by running
this command on the snapshot.debian.org server:

psql service=snapshot-guest -t -c "SELECT DISTINCT architecture FROM file_binpkg_mapping WHERE architecture NOT IN ('all', 'freebsd-i386') ORDER BY architecture;" | tr -d ' '

/-------------------------------------------------
| Data files

These are stored in the var/ dir as well as the directories for each
Debian derivative.

HEADER.html: a symlink to documentation for visitors via HTTP
FOOTER.html: a symlink to a footer for visitors via HTTP
.htaccess: sets some parameters for Apache
census.html: the HTML version of the census wiki page
derivatives: a list of names of derivative wiki pages
debtags: list of Packages/Sources URLs for debtags.d.n
distrowatch: distrowatch download statistics
planet-config.ini: config file for Planet Debian derivatives
heads/: small logos for Planet Debian derivatives
template.txt: the text version of the census template wiki page

These are also in the var/ dir but are only created on snapsnot.debian.org:

patches: symlinks mapping human-readable patch names to SHA-1 based names
md5-farm: symlinks mapping MD5 hashes to SHA-1 hashes
sha1-farm: SHA-1 based filesystem of files never in Debian
sha1-changelog: (name, version) tuples of source packages never in Debian
sha1-patches: patches between source packages based on SHA-1 hashes
sha1-lsdiff: lsdiff output from the patches

These are stored in the derivative dirs and are extracted from wiki text:

name: long name
logo: URL to the logo
blogs: URLs to the main blogs
blogs-dev: URLs to the developer blogs
homepage: URL to the homepage
distrowatch: the identifier from distrowatch.com
sources.list: the sources.list snippets

These are stored in the derivative dirs and are downloaded from the Internet:

wiki.txt: the text versions of the derivative wiki pages
apt/: apt package data, including Release/Package/Sources files
blogs-rss: the URLs to RSS feeds for the main blogs
blogs-dev-rss: the URLs to RSS feeds for the developer blogs
logo-img: the image of the logo

These are stored in the derivative dirs and are configuration snippets:

HEADER.html: a symlink to documentation for visitors via HTTP
.htaccess: sets some parameters for Apache
debtags: snippets for use by debtags.debian.net

These are stored in the derivative dirs and are problem reports:

check-sources-list: potential issues with the sources.list snippet
check-package-list: potential issues with the apt metadata
packages_binary_packages: list of binary packages in Packages files
sources_binary_packages: list of binary packages in Sources files
sources_source_packages: list of source packages in Packages files
packages_source_packages: list of source packages in Sources files
diff_source_packages: diff of sources_source_packages and packages_source_packages

These are also in the derivs dirs but are only created on snapsnot.debian.org:

patches: symlinks mapping human-readable patch names to SHA-1 based names
sources.patches: package name/version and patches
sources.links: URLs to modified source packages
sources.stamp: implementation detail due to a deficiency in make
sources.new: source packages that were never in detail
sources.log: log file from the compare-source-package-list script

Files named *.remote-timestamp store remote timestamps to reduce downloading.

/-------------------------------------------------
| Package dependencies

These packages are needed for all the scripts that are run by default:

coreutils | busybox
bash | dash | zsh | sh
diffutils
curl
file
sed
apt
perl
libxml-feed-perl
python
python-apt
python-debian
python-imaging

This package is only needed for the download of favicons, which are not
currently used by the census:

libwww-favicon-perl

The packages are only used when running the compare-source-package script,
which is only run on snapshot.debian.org:

python-psycopg2
python-urllib3
python-requests
python-simplejson (optional)
python-yaml
devscripts
patchutils
diffstat
