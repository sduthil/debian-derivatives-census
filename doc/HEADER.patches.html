<h1>Debian derivatives patches</h1>

<p>These patches are created by
<a href="http://manpages.debian.net/man/1/debdiff">debdiff</a> and the
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Integration">Debian derivatives census scripts</a>
and are based on the database and hash-based filesystem of
<a href="http://snapshot.debian.org/">the Debian wayback machine</a> and source packages
from the apt repositories referenced in the apt sources.list snippets from the
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census">Debian derivatives census</a>.
If you have any questions, please contact the
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DerivativesFrontDesk">Debian derivatives frontdesk</a>.
</p>

<p>
Many derivatives have different vision, practices, policies, release
schedules, goals and priorities to Debian, all of which may be reflected in
the patches produced.
If you contact any derivatives about these patches, please be polite and
courteous.
You should also keep in mind that your assumptions about individual patches
may be incorrect due to the differences between Debian and our derivatives.
When contacting them, you might like to point derivatives at the
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Guidelines">guidelines</a>
for our derivatives.
</p>

<p>The current limitations of the patches generation are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Old patches are not yet removed regularly.</li>
<li>There is no mechanism for filtering out patches.</li>
<li>There is no web UI for marking patches as merged, rejected etc.</li>
<li>Patches larger than 15MB are only available via <a href="rsync://stabile.debian.org/qa-derivs/census/">rsync</a>.</li>
</ul>
